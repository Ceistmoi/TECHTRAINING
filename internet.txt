Throughout the month, the class delved into several interesting topics. One significant highlight was the introduction of the "$1000 DOLLAR TECH secret" document, offering valuable advice on diverse career paths for tech enthusiasts. This document played a crucial role in initiating our first project, "Project AISHA," where we utilized the insights from the $1000 TECH secret to help AISHA find her optimal career path.

The classes also covered the fundamentals of the internet, focusing specifically on browsers and the underlying workings of the internet. Students gained insights into various transfer protocols, including HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, FTP, SMTP, the Domain Name System, and Secure Shell.

We tackled Github with  an introduction to GitHub, GitHub cheat sheets and learned about essential concepts such as repositories, and finally working on our very first repository.
